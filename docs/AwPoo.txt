8 led buttons

Select button
Go button (PWM LED button - pulse when game is ready to go)
Countdown timer display (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1110 ? ) - I2C (two pins)

*** This could control the display, joystick and select button with just two I2C- (need only 10 more GPIO pins)
Player name Display?

REQUIRES SEPARATE "SELECT" BUTTON

-- Check what you have

External Display
* Connect to Pi HDMI so that any HDMI screen can be used

FOR V1: *** For now use one that you have ***
- https://www.adafruit.com/product/3932 - Uses ALL pins on pi :-(

- https://www.adafruit.com/product/2718 -
Nice display but:
* Don't need touch screen
* Uses ribbon cable to connect, need to mount pi on back of display
--- Could build button unit as peripherial and use this
----- one pi in each, bluetooth connection?
